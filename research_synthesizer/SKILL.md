## 📋 Synthesis Process

```
Raw Data → Themes → Insights → Recommendations
```

### Steps
1. **Collect** - Collect all sources
2. **Organize** - Group by themes
3. **Analyze** - Find patterns
4. **Synthesize** - Extract insights
5. **Recommend** - Suggest actions

---

## 🔧 Synthesis Template

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: [Topic]

## Executive Summary
[1-2 paragraph summary]

## Key Findings

### Theme 1: [Theme Name]
- Finding 1.1
- Finding 1.2
> Supporting quote or data

### Theme 2: [Theme Name]
- Finding 2.1
- Finding 2.2

## Insights
1. **Insight 1**: [Explanation]
2. **Insight 2**: [Explanation]

## Recommendations
| Priority | Action     | Impact | Effort |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| High     | [Action 1] | High   | Med    |
| Med      | [Action 2] | Med    | Low    |

## Sources
1. [Source 1]
2. [Source 2]
```

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition

### Affinity Mapping
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Theme A                    │
│  ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌──────┐        │
│  │Note 1│ │Note 2│ │Note 3│        │
│  └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Cross-Reference Matrix
| Source    | Theme A | Theme B | Theme C |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Study 1   | ✓       | ✓       |         |
| Study 2   | ✓       |         | ✓       |
| Interview |         | ✓       | ✓       |

## 🔄 Workflow

> **Source:** [UX Research Cheat Sheet](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/) & [Qualitative Data Analysis](https://help.doshare.me/qualitative-data-analysis-guide)

### Phase 1: Analysis (Thematic)
- [ ] **Tagging**: Code raw data (notes, transcripts) by "Tag"ging (e.g., "Pain Point", "Feature Request").
- [ ] **Affinity Mapping**: Create "Theme"s by grouping similar tags.
- [ ] **AI Assistance**: Use LLM to summarize large text chunks or perform sentiment analysis.

### Phase 2: Synthesis (Generating Insights)
- [ ] **One-Pager**: Summarize each finding in a single sentence ("Users feel Y when doing X because Z").
- [ ] **Confidence**: State how strong the findings are (How many users said this? What is the evidence?).
- [ ] **Triangulation**: Cross-verify data coming from different sources (Analytics + Interview + Survey).

### Phase 3: Communication
- [ ] **Hierarchical**: Put top 3 most important findings at the top. Provide details as attachments (Appendix).
- [ ] **Visuals**: Use word cloud, chart or user journey map.
- [ ] **Actionable**: Add a "How Might We" question or recommendation for each insight.

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Do insights rely on data? (Is there a Quote or numerical data?).               |
| 2     | Was Confirmation Bias check done? (Are only data supporting thesis selected?). |
| 3     | Were privacy rules followed? (Were user names anonymized?).                    |
