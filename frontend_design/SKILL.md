## 🎭 Aesthetic Directions

| Style            | Feature                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Brutally Minimal | White space, few elements           |
| Maximalist       | Dense, layered, bold                |
| Retro-Futuristic | Neon, gradient, 80s vibes           |
| Luxury/Refined   | Premium, gold/black                 |
| Editorial        | Magazine layout, typography focused |
| Playful          | Pastel, rounded, animations         |
| Industrial       | Raw, monospace, utility-first       |

## 🎯 Guidelines

### Typography
| ❌ AVOID              | ✅ PREFER                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Inter, Roboto, Arial | Distinctive display fonts |
| System fonts         | Unique pairings           |

### Color
| ❌ AVOID                  | ✅ PREFER                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Purple gradient on white | Dominant + sharp accent       |
| Generic palettes         | CSS variables, cohesive theme |

### Motion
```
Focus: High-impact moments
- Staggered page load reveals
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Surprising hover states
```

### Composition
```
✅ Asymmetry · Overlap · Diagonal flow
✅ Grid-breaking · Generous negative space
❌ Predictable layouts · Cookie-cutter patterns
```

*Frontend Design v1.1 - Enhanced*

## 🔄 Workflow

> **Source:** [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) & [Awwwards Evaluation](https://www.awwwards.com/jury-member/evaluation-system)

### Phase 1: Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] **Scale**: Do not just make important elements bigger, make them *much* bigger.
- [ ] **Contrast**: Direct attention using color contrast.
- [ ] **WhiteSpace**: Use white space actively as an element (Let it breathe).

### Phase 2: Implementation Details
- [ ] **Animation**: Add micro-interactions (Button hover, Page transition).
- [ ] **Images**: Optimize images (WebP, Lazy Load) and preserve aspect-ratio.
- [ ] **Typography**: Adjust line-height and letter-spacing.

### Phase 3: Polish
- [ ] **Consistency**: Does Padding and Margin values come from a system (Design Tokens)?
- [ ] **Responsive**: Does layout change, not just shrink?

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Does a visitor say "Wow" in the first 3 seconds? |
| 2     | Is color palette limited to 3-4 main colors?     |
| 3     | Are clickable areas large enough on mobile?      |
