## ⏰ When To Use?

| Scenario                | Example                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Architectural decisions | Monolith vs microservices |
| Performance             | Slow query analysis       |
| Complex bug             | Race condition            |
| System design           | Auth system               |
| Risk analysis           | Change effects            |

## 🚫 When NOT To Use!

| Condition          | Why?                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Simple bug fix     | Overthink - waste of time       |
| Single file change | Unnecessary analysis            |
| Clear requirement  | Time for execution not thinking |
| Routine tasks      | Standard skills are enough      |

> **Rule:** DO NOT use UltraThink for tasks solvable in 5 minutes!

## 📊 Depth Levels

| Level  | Step  | When?                 |
| ------ | ----- | --------------------- |
| Light  | 3-5   | Simple decision       |
| Medium | 8-15  | Multiple dependencies |
| Deep   | 20-40 | System wide           |
| Ultra  | 50+   | Critical architecture |

## 🔍 5-Step Reality Check

Before every operation:

1. **Intent:** What does the user want?
2. **Context:** Am I in the right place?
3. **Action:** What am I doing?
4. **Rationale:** Why like this?
5. **Ripple Effect:** What might break?

## 🏷️ AoT Tag Structure

Use this XML structure in complex analyses:

```xml
<thinking>
  Analyze the problem. List hypotheses.
  Do not write any code, just think.
</thinking>

<plan>
  1. Step 1
  2. Step 2
  3. Step 3
</plan>

<reflection>
  Is this plan correct? Are there alternatives?
  Perform risk analysis.
</reflection>
```

## 🔄 Workflow

> **Source:** [Chain of Thought Prompting (Google Research)](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-research-ai-reasoning/) & [System 2 Thinking Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)

### Phase 1: Problem Decomposition
- [ ] **Goal Atomic Analysis**: Break down the problem into its smallest independent parts (atomic parts).
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping**: Map out technical and logical dependencies between parts.
- [ ] **Constraints Identification**: Identify technical, budgetary, or time-related boundaries.

### Phase 2: Hypothesis & Simulation
- [ ] **Multi-Hypothesis Generation**: Generate at least 3 different solution approaches (H1, H2, H3).
- [ ] **Mental Sandbox**: Simulate how each solution behaves in edge cases.
- [ ] **Critique Phase**: Ruthlessly critique weak points (Bias/Overhead) of each hypothesis.

### Phase 3: Decision & Execution Plan
- [ ] **Selection Rubric**: Select the best solution based on performance, risk, and maintainability criteria.
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Roadmap**: Divide the solution into small applicable steps.
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: Define how we will understand that the plan is successful (KPI/Test).

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Is the "Overthink" trap fallen into? (Simplicity check) |
| 2     | Are needs of all stakeholders (User/System) considered? |
| 3     | Does the plan contain Reversible steps?                 |
