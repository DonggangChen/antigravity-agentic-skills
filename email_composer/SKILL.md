## 🎯 Best Practices

| Do                  | Don't                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Clear subject line  | Vague "Quick question"  |
| One topic per email | Multiple unrelated asks |
| Bullet points       | Long paragraphs         |
| Specific CTA        | Unclear next steps      |
| Proofread           | Send without review     |

## 🔄 Workflow

> **Source:** [Grammarly Business Email Guide](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/category/business-email/)

### Phase 1: Draft
- [ ] **Objective**: Why am I sending this email? (To inform? To ask a question?)
- [ ] **Subject**: Summarize the topic in fewer than 5 words (`Subject: Project X Status Update`).
- [ ] **Context**: Establish context in the first sentence after "Hi [Name]," (`Regarding our meeting...`).

### Phase 2: Refine
- [ ] **BLUF**: Bottom Line Up Front - Put the main message at the beginning, don't save it for the end.
- [ ] **Tone Check**: Is it aggressive or too formal? Be `Polite` but `Direct`.
- [ ] **Formatting**: Break long paragraphs into bullet points.

### Phase 3: Finalize
- [ ] **CTA**: Is there a clear "Next Step"? (`Please review by Friday`).
- [ ] **Attachments**: Did you say "Attached" but forget to attach it? Check it.
- [ ] **Proofread**: Did you spell the name correctly? Are there typos?

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Does the subject line explain the content without opening the email? |
| 2     | Is the main message visible without scrolling on mobile?             |
| 3     | Does the recipient know what to do ("Reply", "Review", "Ignore")?    |
