> **Source:** [The Design Sprint (Google Ventures)](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) & [Design Thinking Process (Interaction Design Foundation)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process)

### Phase 1: Empathy & Research
- [ ] **Discovery**: Define the problem and identify user pain points.
- [ ] **User Persona**: Create target audience models and user journeys (Journey Mapping).

### Phase 2: Ideation & Prototyping
- [ ] **Wireframing**: Draw low-fidelity (Low-fi) skeleton structures.
- [ ] **UI Design**: Produce high-fidelity (Hi-fi) screens adhering to the design system (Design System).
- [ ] **Prototyping**: Define transitions between screens and micro-interactions (Animations).

### Phase 3: Validation & Handoff
- [ ] **Testing**: Test the design with usability tests.
- [ ] **Handoff**: Document and transfer the design to the software team (e.g., via Figma Dev Mode).

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Does the design comply with accessibility (WCAG) standards?        |
| 2     | How does the design look on different screen sizes (Responsive)?   |
| 3     | Was user feedback included in the design cycle (Iterative design)? |
