### Phase 1: Structure & Tone

- [ ] **Outline**: Arrange document headings (Header hierarchy) in a logical order.

### Phase 2: Content Creation
- [ ] **Clarity**: Explain complex terms, use short and concise sentences.
- [ ] **Visuals**: Support complex data with tables, charts, or diagrams (Mermaid/SVG).
- [ ] **Consistency**: Use the same font, color palette, and terminology throughout the document.

### Phase 3: Review & Formatting
- [ ] **Proofreading**: Check for spelling and grammar errors.
- [ ] **Export**: Export the document to the target format (PDF, DOCX, MD) with the appropriate template.
