### Phase 1: Scope & Competitor Identification
- [ ] **Tiering**: Identify Direct, Indirect, and Substitute competitors.
- [ ] **KPI Selection**: Select metrics to compare (Pricing, Feature Set, Market Share, Tech Stack).
- [ ] **Tool Setup**: Stop manual tracking; configure monitoring tools (Google Alerts, SimilarWeb, AppAnnie).

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Intelligence
- [ ] **Digital Footprint**: Scan competitor websites, social media, job postings, and press releases.
- [ ] **Tech Profiling**: Understand competitor tech stack (BuiltWith/Wappalyzer).
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Get field intelligence (Battlecards) from sales and support teams.

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Strategy (Action)
- [ ] **SWOT/TOWS**: Turn data into action. Are competitor weaknesses our opportunities?
- [ ] **Gap Analysis**: Report missing features or service gaps.
- [ ] **Executive Report**: Visualize analysis and integrate into product/marketing roadmap.

### Checkpoints
| Phase | Verification                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Is competitor price change or new feature announcement tracked instantly? |
| 2     | Does "Our Advantage" section overlap with competitor weaknesses?          |
| 3     | Is an "Action Plan" created based on analysis?                            |
